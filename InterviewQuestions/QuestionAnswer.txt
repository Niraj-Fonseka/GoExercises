Question : 
In this piece of code we are iterating over an array ( slice ) of structs
and generate usernames for each user. The user name format should be FirstName_LastName
the expected output is something like this 

Expected Output :
[{Hee Littrell Hee_Littrell} {Laurice Doig Laurice_Doig} {Adelina Chavera Adelina_Chavera} {Chester Quinlan Chester_Quinlan}]

but the current out put is this :
[{Hee Littrell None} {Laurice Doig None} {Adelina Chavera None} {Chester Quinlan None}]

What are we doing wrong ? 

Solution :
whenever we indexAddr := names[index] go creates a copy of the struct the index is indexing to. So any 
modification we do for that copy won't be reflected in the original data strucutre. Therefore to fix this 
we will have to extract the address of the struct the index is indexing to and do the modification to the 
data structure that address is ponting to. That way we can be sure we are actually modifying the original
instead of a copy.
