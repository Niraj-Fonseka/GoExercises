* Concurrency is not Parallelism 


Concurrency - Working on single thread
Parallelism - Working on tasks at the same time 

* Concurrency Models - 

Processor Threads - 

Process has multiple threads ( Runs the application in context of a process)
Threads share the same memory managed by the process 
Mutex ( Mutually exculsive lock )

Advantages .. 
    Gives a lot of control
    Performence can be improved .. ( maybe ... )

Disadvantages ..
    Reduce Perfoemce ( Overuseing constructs )
    Memory Consumption 
    Race Conditions ( Therads fighting for the same resource)


Events - 

Emitter - generates the event depending on an external stimuli 
Recivers - Listens to messages sent by emitters creates events 
EventObject - Sending messages from emitter to Reciver

Advantags ..
Memory Isolation
Seperate Callee from caller 


Disadvantages .. 
Emitters dont know about recivers ( tracability )
Synchronizing recivers


CallBacks and Promises

Callback - When the task is complete the callback func is startsd
Promise - Return value. Returnns even before the callback finishes ( feel of the sychronous )

advantages ..
Memory Isolation
Simplyfy Asynch Operations

Disadvantages 
Pyramid of Doom - Nested callbacks, Very hard to figure out when an error occurs 
Handle Multiple Recivers 



Concurrency In Golang : 

Actor Model : 
Cant directly minupulate threads 
GoRotines 
    - Not processor threads , virtual threads 
    - Runs in go runtime 
    - The stackspace for goroutines is very small 
    -- Channel 
        - Channels can be used to pass messages through goroutines
